  abstract = {Urban microsimulators have been increasingly used to forecast land use, environmental and transportation conditions in cities and are a major tool for stakeholders to analyze the effects of urban policy. Although demographic and residential land use models have been well developed for the majority of these systems, labour market conditions and the forecasting of future jobs have at best been limited to high-level exogenous processes. This thesis aims to develop and implement a truly endogenous job supply and job matching model for use with the Integrated Land Use, Transportation, Environment (ILUTE) modelling system. Jobs within the system are tracked individually at both the occupational and industrial level, and matching occurs within an open market framework in an effort to simulate the true macroeconomic conditions of the real world. iii Adam Harmon MASc Thesis Acknowledgments},

It examines several important design advances that emerged during the transition from a conceptual framework to operational code. ILUTE (Integrated Land Use, Transportation, Environment) simulates the evolution of an integrated urban system over an extended period of time. This model is intended to replace conventional models for the analysis of a broad range of transportation, housing and other urban policies. An overview of the ILUTE framework was presented at the 9th IATBR conference (Miller and Salvini, 2001). Since then, considerable progress has been made on the overall model and its component sub-models. At present, an operational prototype is being tested using data from the Greater Toronto Area. Disaggregate information for the model is synthesized from census data, travel survey data, activity data, and randomly generated proxy data.

   abstract = {Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious "momentum" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.},

   abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

The chapter describes the distinction between wage gaps and wage gains. The likelihood that micro, ordinary least squares (OLS), and CS wage gap estimates are selectivity biased has not escaped the notice of econometricians and recently a substantial number of papers have appeared that use techniques designed to reduce this bias.

The pure surplus or economic rent that public sector workers received relative to their private sector counterparts was $492, or 6.2 per cent, for males and $383, or 8.6 per cent, for females. The public sector wage advantage was larger for low-wage workers, illustrating the basic dilemma that policies to curb the advantage may conflict with the desire to raise the wages of low-wage workers and achieve equal pay for equal work between males and females. /// Les différentiels de salaire entre le secteur public et le secteur privé. A partir des données du recensement de 1971, l'auteur calibre des équations de salaires pour les travailleurs du secteur public et pour les travailleurs du secteur privé. Il décompose le différentiel de salaire moyen en deux portions: l'une attribuable à des différentiels de dotation de caractéristiques ayant un effet de productivité et l'autre attribuable à une rente économique dévolue aux porteurs de ces mêmes caractéristiques. La rente économique que recoivent les travailleurs du secteur public par rapport à leurs collègues du secteur privé est de l'ordre de $492 (soit 6.2 pour cent) pour les hommes et de $383 (soit 8.6 pour cent les femmes). Le différentiel de salaire en faveur du secteur public est plus élevé pour les travailleurs à plus bas salaire.
