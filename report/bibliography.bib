  abstract = {Urban microsimulators have been increasingly used to forecast land use, environmental and transportation conditions in cities and are a major tool for stakeholders to analyze the effects of urban policy. Although demographic and residential land use models have been well developed for the majority of these systems, labour market conditions and the forecasting of future jobs have at best been limited to high-level exogenous processes. This thesis aims to develop and implement a truly endogenous job supply and job matching model for use with the Integrated Land Use, Transportation, Environment (ILUTE) modelling system. Jobs within the system are tracked individually at both the occupational and industrial level, and matching occurs within an open market framework in an effort to simulate the true macroeconomic conditions of the real world. iii Adam Harmon MASc Thesis Acknowledgments},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a new agent-based microsimulation (ABM) model of urban labour markets, in which workers actively seeking employment in each time period are matched with vacant jobs. The model is designed to operate within the Integrated Land Use, Transportation, Environment (ILUTE) urban simulation model system. In the current model application, 1986 is taken as the base year, with 20-year simulations being run (1986–2006) to test the model’s performance within a known historical time-period.},
